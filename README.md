# Happiest City

Research Question
Is it possible to predict the happiest city in the United States? If so, which city is it and what makes it the happiest?

Hypothesis
The happiest city in the United States will have most of the population with a roof over their heads, a stable job, a low crime rate, and good traffic conditions. We predict that the cities with a good employment rate will see it increase over upcoming years and eventually help residents buy houses and other commodities, reducing the need to commit crimes. This would eventually result in the happiest city in the United States.

Result: head to the finalproject notebook and see for yourself!
