    "This question is of interest to us since we are all from different cities in the world, and we have different stories of our cities. We wanted to see which city in the world would be the best one to live in, and when talking about crime, we realized that money was the main issue. Too little caused crimes, and most of the bad things in the city, so we thought of predicting the income of cities until it led to our current project. It is important since we need to understand why some cities are happier than others, and how is it possible to make all better.\n",

    "The first study was suggested to us by Professor Voytek. It essentially analyzes data to find the happiest state in the United States, defining happiness as well-being. It introduces many concepts that help the researchers give a numerical value to well-being as well as calculating said number from datasets. It relates to our project since it accomplishes what we are trying to achieve, albeit in a smaller scale of a single country. It takes many variables into account and discusses any confounding variables that could skew results, giving us a certain guide on how to procceed if issues like this arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second one discusses the specifics of the relationship between happiness and money. Since we hypothesize that better employment rates will eventually result in a happier city overall, we need to understand the underlying meaning of happiness in this scenario. How it makes people happier, any consequences of a sudden gain in wealth, and so on. These publications will certainly help us arrive at a conclusion on the definition of happiness in cities when correlated to money directly. While wealth may resolve any problems for cities, it can also backfire in many ways, and we need to consider any possible negative effects of growing employment rates. The third resource can help describe ways people may react, and we can adjust data accordingly and make better predictions.\n"

The preprocessing steps that are required for our method is to analyze the data plots to check whether the data is skewed or whether the graphs contain any extreme outliers, then we will make the decision of whether data transformation is needed to be performed. In addition, if there are missing, we can use replacing the data with mean or dropping the rows of data with missing data to avoid skewing the data. By visualizing each dataset, we will have a better understanding of how each factor contributes to our research question. \n",
    "To apply our chosen method to our data, first we need to check for missing or erroneous data in our datasets. We can then replace or drop the data as needed. Secondly, we can quickly visualize the distributions of our data using histograms and a scatter matrix for multivariate distributions In the case of data being skewed (as is likely for data such as income, which tends to follow a lognormal distribution), we can perform a log10 transformation on the data set to normal it, which is easier to handle in parametric analysis. Next, we will perform correlational statistical tests on the data. Lastly, we will use these observations to make a prediction about the happiest city in the world.\n",
